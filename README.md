# Digit-Classification based on Neural Networks
The project employs a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) to classify digits using images
from the MNIST dataset. Leveraging image
processing, OpenCV, and neural networks, it
accurately identifies and outputs handwritten
data corresponding to the provided MNIST
image.
